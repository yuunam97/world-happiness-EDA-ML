# :bar_chart: WORLD HAPPINESS ANALYSIS :bar_chart:

### Description: 
This analysis looked at the number of factors affecting the happiness score in the world. EDA was conducted, followed by a regression analysis on predicting the target variable, `happy_score`. The dataset utilized for this analysis was from [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/) dataset. I used the data from year 2021, and 2023.

### Tools used for EDA and Regression analysis:
- tidyverse   (1.3.0)
- lubridate   (1.9.3)
- janitor     (2.2.0)
- dplyr       (1.1.3)
- ggplot2     (3.4.4)
- ggcorrplot  (0.1.4.1)
- plotly      (4.10.3)
- modelr      (0.1.11)

### The goal of this project:
1. Explore the World Happiness Data
2. Which country is the happiest? 
3. Identify which factors contributes to the most towards happiness score.
4. What are the correlation between the features and the target variable `happy_score`?
5. Regression analysis on the predicting the happy score.  

### What I've learned:
1. EDA using R.
2. Data Visualization using ggplot2, and plotly to produce graphs like archarts, linecharts, etc.
3. Regression Analysis to make prediction on the continous variables based on other features. 
4. Statistical analysis using ANOVA to determine which models performs the best. 
5. Should consider Denmark, Finland or Switzerland since they are the most happiest country in the world[?]:satisfied:
